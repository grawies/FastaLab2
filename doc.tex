\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Superconductors}
The resistivity of a metal depends on its temperature.
For some metals and alloys the resistivity falls to zero for temperatures below
a critical temperature $T_c$, mostly in the liquid helium range.
At this temperature the material undergoes a phase transition to a \emph{superconducting} state.
These materials are called \emph{superconductors}.

\subsection{The Meissner Effect}
Interesting effects depending on the temperature arise when an external
magnetic field is applied to the superconductor. For sufficiently small
magnetic fields $H_a=B_a / \mu_0$ the superconductor behaves as a perfect
diamagnet. The total field $B$ is temperature dependent, $B(T)$, and inside the
superconductor at low $H_a$ the field is $B(T)=0$. This effect is called the
\emph{Meissner effect}.
However, when the applied magnetic field reaches a threshold $H_c(T)$ the magnetization disappears
and the superconductivity is destroyed.

\subsection{Type I and type II superconductors}
There are two types of superconductors, \emph{type I} and \emph{type II}.
They differ in how they behave when an applied magnetic field destroys the superconductivity.\\
Type II superconductors behave like perfect diamagnets up to a first critical magnetic field $H(T)=H_{c1}(T)$.
As $H$ increases past $H_{c1}$ the magnetization decreases in magnitude until
it reaches $0$ at a point $H(T)=H_{c2}(T)$ where it finally loses its superconducting properties.\\
Type I superconductors do not have this intermediate state between $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$.
This could be expressed as $H_{c1}=H_{c2}=H_c$, although $H_c$ is for almost all type I conductors lower than $H_{c2}$ for type II superconductors, making type I inappropriate for some applications.\\
The behaviours of the different types of superconductors are shown in figure \ref{fig:superconductortypes}.

\subsection{Measuring the critical temperature $T_c$}
A simple way to determine $T_c$ for a superconducting material is to measure
the electrical resistance over a piece of material whilst varying the
temperature.
The resistance will suddenly drop when we get below the critical temperature.

\subsection{Four-point probe measurement of resistance}
To measure the resistance over a piece of superconducting material is not as straightforward as measuring over normally conducting materials. The measurement is achieved with a four-point probe measurement.
\image{fourpoint}{The setup of the four-point measurement used in this laboratory. Two separate electrical circuit loops ensure contact voltage drops are taken into account in the measurement. Image taken from the lab instruction.}
In Figure \ref{fig:fourpoint}, the points 1 and 4 are the contacts of a loop feeding a constant current over the superconducting material, in this lab the current is 140 mA.
When the material is in a superconducting state the resistance is so low that the voltage drop over the current loop contacts is no longer negligible.
In a four-point measurement we're measuring the voltage not with the circuit supplied with the contacts of the current loop, but with a separate loop connecting at points 2 and 3 in Figure \ref{fig:fourpoint}.
The high impedance of the voltmeter ensures that the current flow in this loop is minimized.
This also minimizes the potential drop over the contacts, resulting in only the resistance of the superconducting sample between points 2 and 3 is registered. 

\section{Experimental procedure}
The superconducting material in this experiment is a bulk ceramic sample of
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO), a type II superconductor.
The sample is mounted in a measuring module that feeds a constant current $I$
over the sample and at the same time measures the voltage $U$ over the sample.
$U$ is reported as $U_{B1}$ in the measuring software.
The voltage is measured as a four-point measurement.
There is an iridium resistor in contact with the YBCO sample.
A fixed current is maintained over the resistor.
The voltage over the resistor is transformed to a temperature measurement in the lab software.\\
Given a constant current, the voltage is effectively a measure of the sample
resistance $R$ through Ohm's law $U=RI$.
When the resistance drops to 0 the voltage does too since there is no voltage drop over zero resistance.\\
The module is lowered into liquid nitrogen to below the critical temperature and then lifted out.
This results in a temperature-voltage curve running from room temperature to below the critical temperature and back up again.
The measurements were cancelled before reaching room temperature again.

\section{Measurements results}
The resulting temperature-voltage curve is shown in figure
\ref{fig:temperature-voltage}. Between $T = 99.65$ K and $T = 96.15$ K the
voltage rapidly (and hence resistance) drops to near 0 when cooling down and in
the same interval when warming in room temperature it sharply increases to the
same voltage level (and hence resistance levels) as before entering the superconducting state.

\section{Discussion of the results}
The highest temperature at which the sample was superconducting was $T_c = 96.15$, which is taken to be the critical temperature.\\
This is a few Kelvin higher than the critical temperature $T_c^{theory}=90.0$ K
tabulated in \cite{Kittel}.\\
Variations between measurements with the same equipment and setup are unlikely to alter the result much, as the measured temperature interval in which the sample transitions to or from the superconducting state was identical for cooling and warming, although the measurements were done close in time.
The voltage curve is different when warming the sample from the curve obtained when cooling it.

This difference in measurements could be due to temperature variations when cooling and heating.
The temperature measurement method assumes that the temperature probe (iridium)
and subject (YBCO) are in thermal equilibrium during the entire process. This
is an idealization and will not be full-filled in this experiment.
The cooling process is faster than the heating process, which would cause more
variations which would imply that the reported voltage is for a different
subject temperature than the reported from the temperature probe.
If the YBCO subject is warmer than the iridium resistor then the reported
temperature would have a higher reported voltage, and vice versa.
